# time-block-scheduler

## Description

This is a foray into the use of third party APIs, utilizing JQuery, Bootstrap, and dayJS to extend our knowledge further. We were tasked with putting together an hourly planner that reflect accurate dates and times, color coordinating text field dependent upon time of day, and local storage to keep our planner functional when we return to the screen at a later time.


## Usage

Simply type what you would like to accomplish in the text field, hit the save button, and it will remain there until further notice. Utilized that colors to be notified whether your tasks is logged on time in the past (gray), present (red), or future (green) to help you stay more organized in a time-block fashion.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
